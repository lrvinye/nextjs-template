There are some [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Templates created by [lrvinye](https://github.com/lrvinye).

## Starter

- [Redux toolkit for state management (with redux-persist)](https://github.com/lrvinye/nextjs-template/tree/redux-toolkit)
- [TailwindCss as style design](https://github.com/lrvinye/nextjs-template/tree/tailwindcss)
- [i18Next & react-i18next for i18n translation](https://github.com/lrvinye/nextjs-template/tree/i18next)
- [React-Query state persistent](https://github.com/lrvinye/nextjs-template/tree/react-query)

## Getting Started

Firstly, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Them, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
